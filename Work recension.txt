1.3.1. There is no strong difference (0.01 sec or less) what to use: iteration or recursion because execution time is equal for both methods
But in me honest opinion, recursion method is better choice in case of its compactness.

1.3.3. Iteration method is much better because recursion has a recursion deepth limit and user can't use this ahgorithm 
with 1000 elements or more; iteration method can. On the small numbers it works equal.

1.4.1. Recursion method is better because it executes an average of 0.05 seconds faster than iteration method.

1.4.2 Iteration method is much better because recursion has a recursion deepth limit and user can't use this ahgorithm 
with large numbers; iteration method can. On the small numbers it works equal.

1.4.3. Recursion method is much better because it executes an average of 0.1-0.2 seconds faster than iteration method with large numbers.
